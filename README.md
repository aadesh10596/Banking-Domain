## Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard

Power BI | Python (EDA) | Business Intelligence

### Project Overview

This project focuses on risk analytics in the banking domain, aiming to help banks make data-driven lending decisions and minimize the risk of loan defaults.
It combines Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with interactive Power BI dashboards to analyze customer financial behavior, engagement, loans, and deposits.

### Problem Statement

Banks face significant financial risk while lending money to customers.
The challenge is to:

Identify low-risk vs high-risk customers

Understand loan and deposit patterns

Improve loan approval decisions using data analytics

### Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboards

Python (Jupyter Notebook) – Data cleaning & EDA

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib – Analysis & visualization

DAX – KPI and calculated measures

Microsoft Excel / CSV – Source data

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains multiple interrelated tables, including:

Clients – Banking

Banking Relationship

Gender

Investment Advisor

Period

Relationships are created using primary and foreign keys to enable accurate analysis.

### Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)

Performed in Jupyter Notebook:

Created Engagement Days using date differences

Derived Engagement Timeframe

Categorized customers into Income Bands

Checked for missing values and inconsistencies

Prepared clean data for Power BI modeling

### Power BI KPIs & Metrics

Key KPIs created using DAX:

Total Clients

Total Loan Amount

Total Deposit

Total Fees

Bank Loans

Business Lending

Credit Card Balance

Engagement Length

Savings, Checking & Forex Accounts

### Dashboards Included

Home Dashboard

High-level KPIs and banking health metrics
